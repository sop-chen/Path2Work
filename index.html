            <h3>About Path2Work</h3>
            <p>
                Path2Work supports refugees in Switzerland with job searching. You can be recommended occupations and search 
                for specific jobs here. Every 6 months starting March 2025, one wave consisting of around 17,000 refugees
                are invited to use Path2Work via physical mail from the State Secretariat of Migration. The people assigned
                to each wave are random for fairness and for evaluation of Pwth2Work's effectiveness.

            <h3>Why important</h3>
            <p>
                The Swiss government is trying to integrate Ukrainian refugees into the labor market 
                and is aiming for a 50% employment rate by end-of-year 2025 (for those who have lived in Switzerland 3+ 
                years). However, the employment rate is only 38%. Compare this number to Czechia's, which is 69%. One
                potential reason for this disparity is because of the greater similarities between the national languages
                of Ukraine and Czechia, versus between those of Ukraine and Switzerland.
